# SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM
 Built a distance measuring system using an ultrasonic sensor and STM32F401RBT6 microcontroller. The measured distance is displayed on a 16x2 LCD and simultaneously sent to a remote server for monitoring via ESP8266 using UART communication. Designed for applications requiring real-time distance tracking and remote data logging.
